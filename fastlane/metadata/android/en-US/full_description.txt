**MineBucks** is an open-source Android utility developed to solve the fragmentation of revenue tracking in the Minecraft modding ecosystem. It automates data retrieval from **Modrinth** and **CurseForge**, providing a unified dashboard for creators to monitor their earnings without manual aggregation.

## Project Origins & The Problem

As active mod developers in the Minecraft community, we faced a recurring daily inefficiency. Every morning involved a manual workflow:

1. Navigate to the Modrinth dashboard to check balance.
2. Navigate to the CurseForge Authors portal to check Reward Points.
3. Manually sum the totals.
4. Perform currency conversion (USD/Points to Your Country's Currency) to understand actual earnings.

This repetitive process was inefficient and lacked historical data tracking. We attempted to find existing solutions, but none offered the passive, unified monitoring we required. Thus, MineBucks was architected to utilizing Android's WorkManager to fetch, aggregate, and notify us of financial changes.
